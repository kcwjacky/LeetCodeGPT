## Project Overview

This project provides a web interface generated by Gradio, allowing users to input a LeetCode problem number. The system searches for online resources, organizes contents, and returns the information to the user. Users can select the programming language (Python or C++) for example code. Additionally, users can ask follow-up questions based on the feedback, and ChatGPT will provide further clarification.
